# bs-datatable tests
A data table based on bootstrap 5 and jquery 3.5
In this repository, two samples are provided to demonstrate how the data-table api can be used for
1. Creating a data-table purely in memory - static data
2. Create a data-table dependent on the backend for its data and pagination

# How to run the samples
First lets have a look at the final outcome of the sample app. As we can see in the following screen shots, we have demonstrated two samples, one is based on static in memory data and other one is dynamic and dependent on a backend API.

1. Data is read from in memory, supports infinite scroll.

2. Data is read from API, support pagination through callbacks
